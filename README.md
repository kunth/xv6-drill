# xv6-drill
"xv6-drill" is author's recording of the process of learning https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2011/xv6.html.

Quoted from https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2011/xv6/book-rev6.pdf
> This is a draft text intended for a class on operating systems. It explains the main concepts of operating systems by studying an example kernel, named xv6. xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie’s and Ken Thompson’s Unix Version 6 (v6). xv6 loosely
follows the structure and style of v6, but is implemented in ANSI C for an x86-based multiprocessor.

> The text should be read along with the source code for xv6. This approach is inspired by John Lions’s Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer to Peer Communications; ISBN:1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14, 2000)). See http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828 for pointers to on-line resources for v6 and xv6.
